# IS215-FinalProject-GroupC
Hi fellow MIS students of University of the Philippines Open University! Welcome to the final project repository of Group C for IS215 - Advanced Computer Systems.   This is the result of our hardwork and collaboration to achieve an article generator using the following:  
-AWS EC2 
-AWS S3 Bucket 
-AWS Lambda 
-ChatGPT API 
-AWS Rekognition

If you need to store Client ID, Client Secret Keys, and API Keys as specified on the project specifications' IMPORTANT REMINDERS section, please message Don Davis Arroyo or Dayvie Laparan. Programmers must use 'dotenv' instead of typing the IDs and Keys as variable because it might affect the security of the API.
